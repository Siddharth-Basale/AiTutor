            "a": "Something that can physically move.",
            "b": "An entity that is programmed with all its behaviors ahead of time.",
            "c": "An autonomous entity that observes its environment, chooses how to act based on observations, and whose actions change the environment's state.",
            "d": "A system that only interacts with other agents."

        "explanation": "Explaination: The video states that an agent is \"something that is autonomous in the sense that it can observe the environment and then on its own choose how to act based on those observations,\" and importantly, \"its actions change the state of the environment.\" Physical movement is a possibility, but not a requirement, and agents can learn rather than being fully pre-programmed."

        "explanation": "Explanation: The speaker illustrates this problem by showing that RL agents would \"trivially optimize the reward at the expense of kind of erasing everything it learned about the data distribution,\" leading to outputs like infinite C's in the music generation task."
